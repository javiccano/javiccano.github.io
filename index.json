Optimal poisoning attacks, which can be formulated as bilevel optimisation problems, help to assess the robustness of learning algorithms in worst-case scenarios. However, current attacks against algorithms with hyperparameters typically assume that these hyperparameters are constant and thus ignore the effect the attack has on them. In this paper, we show that this approach leads to an overly pessimistic view of the robustness of the learning algorithms tested. We propose a novel optimal attack formulation that considers the effect of the attack on the hyperparameters by modelling the attack as a multiobjective bilevel optimisation problem. We apply this novel attack formulation to ML classifiers using L2 regularisation and show that, in contrast to results previously reported in the literature, L2 regularisation enhances the stability of the learning algorithms and helps to partially mitigate poisoning attacks. Our empirical evaluation on different datasets confirms the limitations of previous poisoning attack strategies, evidences the benefits of using L2 regularisation to dampen the effect of poisoning attacks and shows that the regularisation hyperparameter increases as more malicious data points are injected in the training dataset.","tags":null,"title":"Regularisation Can Mitigate Poisoning Attacks: A Novel Analysis Based on Multiobjective Bilevel Optimisation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Muñoz-González","Javier Carnerero-Cano","Kenneth T.

Optimal poisoning attacks have already been proposed to evaluate worst-case scenarios, modelling attacks as a bi-level optimization problem. Solving these problems is computationally demanding and has limited applicability for some models such as deep networks. In this paper we introduce a novel generative model to craft systematic poisoning attacks against machine learning classifiers generating adversarial training examples, i.e. samples that look like genuine data points but that degrade the classifier's accuracy when used for training. We propose a Generative Adversarial Net with three components: generator, discriminator, and the target classifier. This approach allows us to model naturally the detectability constrains that can be expected in realistic attacks and to identify the regions of the underlying data distribution that can be more vulnerable to data poisoning. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our attack to compromise machine learning classifiers, including deep networks.","tags":null,"title":"Poisoning Attacks with Generative Adversarial Nets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Javier Carnerero-Cano","Gabriel Galindo-Romera","José Juan Martínez-Martínez","Francisco Javier Herraiz-Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527807600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527807600,"objectID":"28cde0ec4c15cd76ad70704c33860ad5","permalink":"https://javiccano.github.io/publication/carnerero-2018-contactless/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/carnerero-2018-contactless/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a low-cost contactless passive sensor is designed and manufactured.

One of their advantages is that they can be easily merged with antennas, resulting in wireless and cheap devices. For instance, these sensors can be used for the characterization of the dielectric permittivity, with application in industry, biology or medicine, among others. In this work, a low-cost passive monopole sensor is designed and manufactured. The structure is composed of two Split-Ring Resonators (SRRs) coupled to a short-circuited printed monopole antenna. The permittivity of the dielectrics that are placed over the sensor is characterized within a near-field link between the sensor and a wireless reader, avoiding the use of wired connections. The sensing principle is based on the reader detection of the notch introduced by the SRRs in the power reflected by the sensor. Specifically, when the sensor is covered with a material, the change in the effective permittivity produces a frequency shift of the notch detected by the reader. It is shown that the system can reliably estimate the permittivity of the materials over a reading distance of 1 cm by means of a linear approximation with a small error. As future work, this sensor could be monitored with novel Internet-of-Things readers.","tags":null,"title":"A Near-Field Split-Ring Resonator-Based Monopole Sensor for Permittivity Characterization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Galindo-Romera","Javier Carnerero-Cano","José Juan Martínez-Martínez","Francisco Javier Herraiz-Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504220400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504220400,"objectID":"ee200da3a7d4ccc76cacffae724383cc","permalink":"https://javiccano.github.io/publication/galindo-2017-lector/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/galindo-2017-lector/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, a novel low-cost and portable Internet-of-Things (IoT) reader for the measurement of passive electromagnetic wireless sensors is proposed.
