The system is based on two elements: an electronic reader and a passive sensor. The proposed sensor consists of a printed monopole antenna loaded with two Split-Ring Resonators. This results in a fully-passive and single-layer low-cost design. To allow the sensing of small volumes of liquids, a 1-mm-thick adhesive Kapton layer was attached on the top layer of the sensor, and two drop tanks were added to the structure. On the other hand, the reader was designed following a layered approach, which allows us to develop compact and low-cost electronic sensor readers for the Internet of Things. The resulting reader contains a Radio-Frequency interface for the generation of detection of signals, a minicomputer, and the radiating interface. This interface includes a patch antenna that allows us to interrogate the contactless sensor within a 1-cm range. The whole system was manufactured and tested. The total dimensions of the reader are 15 cm × 15 cm, and its weight is below 1 kg. These imply a dramatic form factor and weight reductions with respect to previous readers. Moreover, the manufactured system was used to measure the dielectric permittivity of different liquid drops. Results show that only 4 ml of liquid were needed to determine the dielectric permittivity with a 0.27% error. This volume means a 98.4% reduction compared to submersible sensors which can be found in the literature.","tags":null,"title":"A Contactless System for the Dielectric Characterization of Liquid Drops","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Javier Carnerero-Cano","Luis Muñoz-González","Phillippa Spencer","Emil C.

Optimal poisoning attacks, which can be formulated as bilevel optimisation problems, help to assess the robustness of learning algorithms in worst-case scenarios. However, current attacks against algorithms with hyperparameters typically assume that these hyperparameters remain constant ignoring the effect the attack has on them. We show that this approach leads to an overly pessimistic view of the robustness of the algorithms. We propose a novel optimal attack formulation that considers the effect of the attack on the hyperparameters by modelling the attack as a multiobjective bilevel optimisation problem. We apply this novel attack formulation to ML classifiers using L2 regularisation and show that, in contrast to results previously reported, L2 regularisation enhances the stability of the learning algorithms and helps to mitigate the attacks. Our empirical evaluation on different datasets confirms the limitations of previous strategies, evidences the benefits of using L2 regularisation to dampen the effect of poisoning attacks and shows how the regularisation hyperparameter increases with the fraction of poisoning points.","tags":null,"title":"Regularisation Can Mitigate Poisoning Attacks: A Novel Analysis Based on Multiobjective Bilevel Optimisation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Muñoz-González","Javier Carnerero-Cano","Kenneth T.

Optimal poisoning attacks have already been proposed to evaluate worst-case scenarios, modelling attacks as a bi-level optimization problem. Solving these problems is computationally demanding and has limited applicability for some models such as deep networks. In this paper we introduce a novel generative model to craft systematic poisoning attacks against machine learning classifiers generating adversarial training examples, i.e. samples that look like genuine data points but that degrade the classifier's accuracy when used for training. We propose a Generative Adversarial Net with three components: generator, discriminator, and the target classifier. This approach allows us to model naturally the detectability constrains that can be expected in realistic attacks and to identify the regions of the underlying data distribution that can be more vulnerable to data poisoning. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our attack to compromise machine learning classifiers, including deep networks.","tags":null,"title":"Poisoning Attacks with Generative Adversarial Nets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Javier Carnerero-Cano","Gabriel Galindo-Romera","José Juan Martínez-Martínez","Francisco Javier Herraiz-Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527807600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527807600,"objectID":"28cde0ec4c15cd76ad70704c33860ad5","permalink":"https://javiccano.github.io/publication/carnerero-2018-contactless/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/carnerero-2018-contactless/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a low-cost contactless passive sensor is designed and manufactured.

One of their advantages is that they can be easily merged with antennas, resulting in wireless and cheap devices. For instance, these sensors can be used for the characterization of the dielectric permittivity, with application in industry, biology or medicine, among others. In this work, a low-cost passive monopole sensor is designed and manufactured. The structure is composed of two Split-Ring Resonators (SRRs) coupled to a short-circuited printed monopole antenna. The permittivity of the dielectrics that are placed over the sensor is characterized within a near-field link between the sensor and a wireless reader, avoiding the use of wired connections. The sensing principle is based on the reader detection of the notch introduced by the SRRs in the power reflected by the sensor. Specifically, when the sensor is covered with a material, the change in the effective permittivity produces a frequency shift of the notch detected by the reader. It is shown that the system can reliably estimate the permittivity of the materials over a reading distance of 1 cm by means of a linear approximation with a small error.
